## General info
This project, Evening Stroll, is a code prototype created for my Working with Data and Code class. Evening Stroll is an ASCII converter that transforms any video into a text-based art animation, turning each frame into a sequence of ASCII characters.
	
## Technologies and Requirements
Evening Stroll is created with:
* Python 3.13.5
* Visual Studio Code
* Python Libraries:
  * Open CV 
  * Pillow 
  * Time

## Features
* Customisable Output
  * Users can adjust the ASCII character set, resolution, and frame rate to create different visual effects.

* Video-to-Text Conversion
  * Transforms any video into a flowing ASCII art animation in real time.

* Real-Time Preview
  * Lets users see the ASCII animation as it’s being processed.


## Setup
Evening Stroll Set Up 

* Project Requirements/Dependencies
  Evening Stroll relies on Python 3 and some key libraries to run. The main dependencies include:
  * OpenCV (opencv-python): For video processing and frame extraction
  * Pilliw (PIL): For image handling and pixel manipulation
  * Time (time) - For controlling frame rates

These dependencies are listed in the projects [Technologies and Requirements](#technologies-and-requirements) section, located here in the repository

* Installation/Set Up
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Install all required dependencies
  3. Run the project 

## Usage 
Evening Stroll converts videos into ASCII art animations. Below are some ways to use it and examples of how to customise the output.

* Basic Usage
  Place video file in the project folder, then run:
     * python3 evening_stroll2.py

* ASCII Character Set
You can achange the characters used to represent brightness levels

* Examples Use Cases
* 1. Artistic Video Animation
  2. Code Learning
  3. Terminal Fun
  
## Room for Improvement
While Evening Stroll is functional, there are some areas where it could be imporoved:
1. Output Options
   * Allow to save ASCII output to a file or export as a video
  
2. Adding Audio
   * Adding an entirely coded song to go with the video was the main goal, but I ran out of time
   * The beat is completed, however, merging the two in the script is yet to be done

## Acknowledgements
* This project was inspired by: This project was inspired by the idea of turning videos into text-based art and exploring creative coding through ASCII animation

* Special Thanks to Evangaline and all my classmates who provided valuable peer feedback.
